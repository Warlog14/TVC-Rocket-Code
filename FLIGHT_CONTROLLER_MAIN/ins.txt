Unpowered Flight()
In this step, Sdcard.LogData and tele.SendTelemetry must be executed. Also, it must be calculated whether the maximum altitude MaxAlt > current height ALT. This should be done via the barometer functions.

Descent()
Here, the Data log function should continue to be executed as well as the tele.Send Telemetry function. Also, a calculation must be made whether the current height falls below a THRESHOLD. If the THRESHOLD is undercut, then the Parachute Servo should be given the value for Parachute Eject.




There, the individual flight phases will be initialized. And the following checkups will be carried out to switch the states.

To switch from PadIdle to Powered Flight, a Liftup Check will be implemented.
This checks whether the acceleration in Z, accZ, is greater than -2. If that is the case, Powered Flight is activated.

To switch from Powered Flight to Unpowered Flight,
it is checked whether the acceleration becomes negative again. Since the fuel has been consumed, and we are no longer actively accelerating.

To switch from Unpowered Flight to Descent, it is checked whether the current altitude ALT is less than the Maximum Altitude MaxALT.

To switch from Descent to Landed, we need to check if the altitude ALT is below a certain threshold, for example, 12 meters.
